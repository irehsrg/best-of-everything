Build a comprehensive product voting website called "Best Of Everything" where users can find and vote on the best products in any category. This should be a complete, deployable web application.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Users can search for any product (vacuum cleaners, cars, microwaves, etc.)
- If a product doesn't exist, users can add it with basic info (name, category, description)
- Users can upvote products they own/recommend (one vote per user per product)
- Display products ranked by votes with vote counts visible
- Categories should be flexible/tag-based rather than rigid hierarchies
- Focus on US market products initially

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use completely free hosting (Firebase, Netlify + Supabase, or Vercel + PlanetScale)
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Fast search functionality across all products
- Simple user authentication (email/password or Google OAuth)
- Clean, modern UI that prioritizes usability over flashiness
- Anti-gaming measures: email verification, rate limiting, basic bot detection

USER FLOW:
1. Homepage with search bar and trending/popular products
2. Search results show products with vote counts
3. Product pages show details, current ranking, and vote button
4. "Add Product" flow for new items
5. Basic user profiles showing voting history

DATA STRUCTURE:
- Products: name, description, category tags, total votes, date added
- Users: email, verified status, join date
- Votes: user_id, product_id, timestamp
- Categories: flexible tagging system

ANTI-MANIPULATION:
- Require email verification to vote
- One vote per user per product
- Rate limiting on voting and product submission
- Flag products with suspicious voting patterns

Set up the entire project structure, implement all features, configure the database, set up authentication, deploy to free hosting, and provide clear documentation for maintenance and updates. Make it production-ready.
